# Dumpster_Dive
This repository contains the scripts for the IOT Dustbin which can sense the garbage and send the data to the municipal to collect them in
an efficient way. The data which is taken are the weight and height of the garbage dumped and the time when it was dumped. The height is
collected using the ultrasonic sensors and the script is (ultrav1.py). The weight is detected using a 40kg load cell and the script is .py.
The library used here is the HX711
